# MMath-Dissertation-Equilibria-of-Self-Gravitating-Fluids

Planets may be modelled as fluids, where there is a force balance between the rotation of the body, gravity and internal pressure.
My dissertation outlines the work made towards this model and the possible shapes that the body may take.

Abstract:

Using the equations of motion a relation is derived that may be used to find possible configurations
to the problem of a uniformly rotating homogeneous body that satisfy equilibrium. The
equilibrium is a force balance between gravitational, centripetal and pressure forces. Configurations
that have an ellipsoidal figure are sought and the gravitational potential at an internal
point is determined and consequently a relation for the gravitational potential energy is derived.
Using these relations two possible equilibrium configurations are found:

• The Maclaurin spheroids

• The Jacobi ellipsoids

where the Maclaurin spheroids constitute a sequence of oblate spheroids that rotate about
their polar axis with uniquely determined angular velocities for each member, and the Jacobi
ellipsoids constitute a sequence of ellipsoids that rotate about their polar axis with a uniquely
defined relationship between their principal semi-axis ratios and corresponding angular velocities.

Investigation of these two sequences reveals the property that the Jacobi ellipsoids bifurcate
from the Maclaurin spheroids at a specific point along the sequence which uniquely binds and
relates these two sequences of ellipsoidal equilibrium configurations.
